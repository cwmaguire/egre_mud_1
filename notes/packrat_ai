Packrat AI

June 30, 2015

Since AI will drop all of their objects on death I’m thinking
of spawning AI “naked” and then having them pick up stuff
they find.
Or, have “pack rat” AI that will gather items and hoard them
away in a particular room, cave, hovel, hut, etc. Villagers might
pick them up to and take them back to stores.
