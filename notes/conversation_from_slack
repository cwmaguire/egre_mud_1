Conversation from #gerlshmud Slack channel

I added Evernote to Slack and was goofing around with clipping an entire day's conversation into Evernote.

10:11 AM PSTYak shaving has become more fun than the actual project1

11:48 AM PSTI'm not familiar with the term (just assumed you were scripting in the Yak language), but looked it up anyway. Good to see much fun is being had, and yak shaving can be productive, so that's good too. Excelletn

11:51 AM PSTFiguring out how to document my emerging protocol is an easier challenge than the MUD itself, but also supports the MUD effort. My MUD has been dragging on for years. If taking some time to work on a supporting project helps, I'm good with that. Not having a way to see the emergent protocol has cost me a lot of debugging time.

11:56 AM PSTYeah the website generating python script project for my D2 mod was quite enjoyable, especially when it seemed like it could benefit other modders too

11:57 AM PSTI could mitigate this at compile time, somewhat. The issue is that I'm adding so many different functions into my handlers. If I made each function explicit, and only put logic in the functions I cared about, then the compiler would tell me when I was calling a non-existent function.e.g. if I put functions for all these in every handler (probably through meta code), then the compiler would know when I was calling one not found in the list:{Item, move, from, BodyPartName, to, Owner} {Item, move, from, current_body_part, to, Owner} {Item, move, from, OldOwner, to, Self, on, body_part, type, BodyPartType} {Item, move, from, Owner, to, BodyPartName} {Item, move, from, Owner, to, first_available_body_part, limited, to, ItemBodyParts} {Item, move, from, Owner, to, first_available_body_part} {Item, move, from, Owner, to, Self, limited, to, ItemBodyParts} {Item, move, from, Owner, to, Self, on, body_part, type, BodyPartType} {Item, move, from, Owner, to, Self} {Item, move, from, Room, to, Self} {Item, move, from, Self, to, BodyPart, on, body_part, type, BodyPartType} {Item, move, from, Self, to, BodyPart, on, body_part, type, BodyPartType} {Item, move, from, Self, to, NewOwner}Right now that would require about 188 functions, but they'd be auto-generated.However, I'd still need to be able to see if I was calling the right function. My spreadsheet allows me to see all similar "functions" (events/messages) grouped together, so I can see if they line up.It actually might be more efficient if I did both.I'd be heading toward Java and away from Erlang: declaring more constraints up front, making more work for myself, in case I run into it in the future.
