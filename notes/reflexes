Reflexes

August 25, 2021
You can defend if you're fast enough ... maybe this should just be part of your defence roll?
Nah, I think fast (add to defence) or slow (subtract from defence) reflexes should modify defences. Maybe attacks too. They could be specific to:a character (+1 to all reactions)an attack type (+2 to all spell reactions)a body part and weapon (-1 to certain weapons wielded with hands)a race (+5 to mongooses for melee and missile defence)etc.
