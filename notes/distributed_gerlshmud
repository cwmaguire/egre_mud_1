YAY!
I was able to connect to ubuntu_server today:erl -sname a -setcookie HSWEOXRSQCZUMGTXSSVXerl -sname server2 -setcookie HSWEOXRSQCZUMGTXSSVXFrom anet_adm:ping(server2@server)nodes()

Once I turned on ufw (uncomplicated firewall) I was no longer able to connect
but I could see in /var/log/ufw.log that it was ufw that was blocking it.
I did:
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24
based on:
https://serverfault.com/questions/74023/ufw-on-ubuntu-to-allow-all-traffic-on-lan
â€¦ and that fixed it
