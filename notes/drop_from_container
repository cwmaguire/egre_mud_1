Drop from container

June 18, 2015

I could disallow dropping from a container
OR
I could have the container re-package the command to drop
it's items.

Can I allow an original command to keep going as well
as resending?

No. Unless you succeed the command doesn't keep getting
forwarded to the next process.

Although, if the container _knew_ it had that item then it doesn't
need to keep passing the command on because it _knows_ no other
process can handle it.

The only problem would be other processes needing to know that a
player is dropping something as opposed to the container dropping
something.

We could always pass the hierarchy of the container.

{drop, Player, Item, [Backpack, Bag, Box]}

That doesn't make sense: we need the target and the source:

{drop, [Player, Backpack, Bag, Box], Item, Room]}
