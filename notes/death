Death

June 28, 2015

How am I going to handle death?
I don’t want to carry state on the player.
Could do an FSM or something, … somewhere.
Could store it in the player object props, but then
I’d always have to refer to it and check it.

You’re life is a process.
It will cancel anything you try to do if you are dead.
It is your state machine, but it doesn’t need to
be part of the player object.
