An Erlang library application includes modules, but doesn't run any.
That's what I want EGRE_MUD MUDs to be: they specify the code to run, but are loaded and run by the EGRE_MUD engine.

Simply don't include a list of modules to be started,
i.e. dont' include: [{mod, {my_mod, []}}] in your .app.src file.
