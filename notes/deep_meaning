Deep Meaning

Feb 16, 2017

I just watched an Extra Credits video on YouTube about deeper meaning in games. It was two videos on game literacy.

What deep meaning, if any, do MUDs have?

Does any MUD have a message?
Do I like games with a message?
No. I have no interest in messages from game developers.
Unless it's really simple, like "keep your eye on the time"
