Counterattack Behaviour
Jan 30, 2016

I have a half-implemented counterattack behaviour which is why my
counterattack test is failing.

Looks like Iâ€™ve moved from always attacking back the latest thing that
attacked to continuing to attack the first target.

I may want to store more recent attacks from other objects to attack
them when the first target is done.
