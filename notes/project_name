"Graph of Erlang Stream Handlers" -> GerlSHMUD
... however, these aren't really "stream" handlers, just event handlers. I mean, there is a stream of events, but, it's not like an audio stream, a video stream, etc. There's nothing being "streamed", just events being generated and manipulated.
Graph of Erlang Event Handlers -> GErlEHMUD ... doesn't have the same ring. Erlang MUD Event Handlers Graph -> EMUDEHG

Whatever, GErlSHMUD works for now

I need a new name for erlmud since another guy has “erlmud” already.
“Graph MUD”?
Terry and Michael had some good ideas but I lost the Slack history.
