Player Feedback Details

Feb 9, 2019

When the MUD sends the player feedback it may not have all the details
for that feedback.

e.g. right now I’m working on spells and when a spell lands I want to tell
the player (and the world, … or maybe just the world):
<<"Bob hits [Target] with fireball spell for 25 damage.”>>
However, the spell effect process doesn’t know how to describe [Target].
So, I’m thinkin’ that the players connection object (or some object) could
capture send messages with missing details and then work out the details
by asking the relevant parties.

e.g.

{send [<<“Bob hits ”>>,
{Target, name},
<<“ with fireball spell for 25 damage.”>>]}

The connection object could then walk over all the places where there’s
a missing piece of info (i.e. {Target, name}) and ask the owner for that
information.

The conn object could send something like {get, property, name} to Target
and Target could modify the message before responding.

AND, this would give other processes a chance to modify the name.
e.g. if their name had an asterisk denoting something, or a colour, or
any other kind of marker, add-on, prefix, suffix, clan name, rank, etc.
