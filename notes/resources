I think attack and defence should share stamina based on the setting the user picks. e.g. reserve enough stamina for two parries before launching any attacks.
The user could even just list what they want to do:
[parry, parry, sword, fireball, heal]
The user could also customize their attack profile for different enemies.
e.g. for easy enemies they could just do:
[sword, heal]
... where heal only fires if the user is wounded.
